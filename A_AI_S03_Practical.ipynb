This can lead to noisy gradient updates, since the composition of each batch is subject to change. [Batch-norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) seeks to address this by normalising and rescaling the activations of each batch, at every layer throughout the network.

In doing so, the approach stops individual network components form memorising the inputs â€“ something which would lead to overfitting. There is a trade off however, as dropping out too many weights will prevent the network from learning well enough and will cause underfitting."
